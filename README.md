# ðŸ’» The Hidden Cost of Overwork: A Data-Driven Analysis
## Project Background
The company name is Thasos. We are a large pharmaceutical company that operates across all six populated continents. It was recently discovered that, although we aim to hire top talent to remain at the cutting edge of our industry, we experience high rates of employee turnover. The issue is of such concern that the Data Analytics team was given the task of finding out both **_why_** employees were leaving, but also **_what_** emergency measures could be implemented to resolve this issue as soon as possible.

The team chose to research **three key areas** and discover their influencing variables to enact swift change:
- Burnout
- Physical Illness
- Mental Illness

## Data Structure & Initial Checks
The dataset constructed came from surveys that were sent company-wide, as shown in Figure 1.

Prior to beginning the analysis, PowerQuery was used to clean and preprocess all of the data. It was also used to query the dataset, leaving us with 3157 lines of clean, ordered, usable data. The data was then imported into Python and subsequently analysed.

## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings

- The optimal working arrangement is **_Hybrid_**. It manages to balance between the high levels of social isolation prevalent amongst Remote workers and the high rates of mental illness amongst Onsite workers.

- In the regions of both Africa & Asia, rates of mental illness are shown to be abnormally high relative to the other regions. This is most likely due to the intense work culture ingrained within those societies, as well as their stigmatisation towards mental health. To counteract this, our company could enact more stringent policies to combat this problem. 

- Physical illness is shown to be a weak indicator of Burnout.
- Mental Illness is a weak indicator of Burnout.

- Demographic variables (age, salary, hours per week) have little change in the outcome of the presence of mental and physical health issues.

### Burnout

- **Burnout is a widely used metric for ranking employee satisfaction** based on many factors such as: workload, organisational culture, management practices and work-life balance, to name a few.

- **Remote workers are experiencing a statistically significant 37.8% higher burnout than their Onsite counterparts.** Thus backing the hypothesis:
  - **_"Work-arrangement is the most significant variable in determining levels of Burnout, with Remote employees experiencing it the most and Onsite employees experiencing it the least."_**

### Physical Illness
- **_"Working at Thasos contributes greatly towards the development of physical illness."_**
  
- **No significant link between work arrangement and increased presence of physical illnesses.** (Figure 4)

  <p><em>Figure 4: Percentage with Physical Illness by Work Arrangement</em></p>
</div>
  
- **Figure 5 shows the _general_ statistical insignificance of job role on physical illness prevalence** across most jobs.

- Several careers show significantly higher rates of physical illnesses than when compared to others **suggesting that job role plays a _significant_ contribution**. 
  - UX Designers are **14.3% _higher_** than Digital Marketing Specialists.
  - IT Support / Financial Analyst
  - HR Manager / Project Manager

- Additionally, all illnesses named in the dataset are musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs) and are all related to poor ergonomics whilst working desk jobs:
  - Eye Strain
  - Neck Pain
  - Shoulder Pain
  - Wrist Pain
  - Back Pain

- **_"Advancements in the age of employees as well as the number of hours worked per week lead to higher rates of physical illness"_**.

- RÂ² is **0.0066 for Age** & **0.0084 for Hours Per Week**. It shows there is practically no correlation between either of these variables and the prevalence of physical illness, which thus disproves the hypothesis for this dataset.

- The data shows no clear link between any social variables and an increased risk of developing physical illness. The only **_real_** indicator is the job role.

- It is still a company-wide epidemic. According to this [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10840111/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), MSDs are present in 33.8% - 95.3% of the adult population globally. That is a massive range. However, our dataset shows that for _all_ jobs, prevalence is in the uppermost percentiles suggesting a major problem at Thasos especially.

- Although not available in this dataset, I would want to conduct a further investigation into what percentage of each shift is spent seated at a desk. The hypothesis we could propose is:
  - **_"A greater proportion of work spent seated at a desk correlates to a greater proportion of MSDs"_**

- The solution I would propose is to make greater investments into more ergonomic working arrangements for all employees. This [study](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/14/9/3034?utm_source=chatgpt.com) showed a meaningful impact across the back, shoulders, neck and wrists; and this [study](https://www.emerald.com/shr/article/doi/10.1108/shr.2011.37210cab.006/354856/Reducing-the-impact-on-employers-and-employees-of) proved a 22:1 return on investment shown in increased productivity (coupled with a physiotherapist phone triage).

- This will reduce the need for employees to take time off or leave the company altogether, thereby lowering employee turnover.

### Mental Illness
- **_"Current working conditions at Thasos contribute greatly towards the development of mental illness."_**

- **Onsite employees are ~9% more likely to develop a mental health condition than both Remote _and_ Hybrid employees.** Although seemingly small, the difference is shown to be statistically significant in Figure 7.

- Figure 8 shows how social isolation can affect mental health, with either extreme being detrimental, suggesting a Hybrid working arrangement is the most beneficial, with a majority focus on working in the office.

- **Employees from both Africa and Asia are shown to have a statistically significantly higher risk of suffering from a mental illness.** With there being no significant difference across the remaining four regions.

</div>

- **_"A typical reflection of poor mental health is a greater number of hours per week worked by employees."_**

- **RÂ² is 0.018 for Work-Life Balance and 0.0020 for Social Isolation.** There is no significant correlation between either of the two variables and Hours (representing hours worked per week). It refutes the hypothesis that working more hours per week harms either Work-Life Balance or Social Isolation.

- **RÂ² is 0.030 for the correlation between Work-Life Balance and Social Isolation.** Although larger than the relationship between either variable and hours per week, it is still below a 0.05 alpha which allows us to write it off as insignificant, proving the hypothesis false.

- **_"Age and Gender both play significant roles in the prevalence of mental illness."_**

- In accordance with the figure below, Male, Female and Non-Binary employees were plotted against their Age by the percentage of them who suffer from a mental illness. The results are below:
  - **Male:**
    - R = -0.052
    - P = 0.894
  - **Female:**
    - R = 0.330
    - P = 0.385
  - **Non-Binary:**
    - R = 0.176
    - P = 0.651

- **No statistically significant results disproved the null hypothesis.**

</div>

- **Working environment is far more influential on mental health than any other variables**. Factors such as hours per week, age or gender were all shown to play little to no role whatsoever.
- **Hybrid working is the most optimal as it balances social isolation and mental health**.
