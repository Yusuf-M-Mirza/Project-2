# ðŸ’» The Hidden Cost of Overwork: A Data-Driven Analysis
## Project Background
If the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it taught us how remote work was shown to be a viable alternative to the previous status-quo of onsite employment. Employees could find themselves eliminating their daily commute to oftentimes crowded office spaces that would usually taken [54 minutes](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/transport-statistics-great-britain-2022/transport-statistics-great-britain-2022-domestic-travel) out of the day. Foregoing this aspect of the professional world has shown strong evidence of [improved productivity](https://hrnews.co.uk/how-remote-working-culture-improves-productivity-in-the-uk/), [mental health](https://www.analytics-365.com/blog/mental-health-benefits-of-remote-work/#:~:text=Remote%20and%20flexible%20work%20offer,mental%20health%20and%20business%20success.), as well as [job satisfaction](https://remote.com/blog/global-hr/global-work-life-survey).

Using the dataset provdied, I will aim to test the validity of these claims. I will be looking into sociological factors of employees such as age, job role and salary and how they influence both physical and mental health. Those findings will then be provided in this report and will be concluded with an 'ideal arrangement' of how we can optimise physical and mental health based on each job in each industry.

Insights are provided investigating how each factor influences mental and phyiscal health:

- **Work Arragement**
- **Age**
- **Job Role**
- **Hours Per Week**
- **Salary Range**
